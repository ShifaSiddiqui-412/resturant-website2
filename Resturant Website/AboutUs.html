            Lebanese way, our menu has something for everyone.
            <br />
            <br />
            One of our specialties is our hearty Syrian breakfast, which includes dishes like fatteh hummus loaded with

        <p id="culture">A Journey of Culture and Flavor
            At <strong><i>Shifa's</i></strong>, we are passionate about sharing the authentic tastes of the Middle East
            with our customers.
            Our
            story begins with our owner, Mamown Srdah, who grew up in Syria and has always had a deep love for the rich
            and
            complex flavors of his culture’s cuisine.
            <br />
            <br />
            In late 2021, Srdah took over <strong><i>Shifa's</i></strong>, which had previously been an Iraqi-owned
            restaurant. With his
            extensive knowledge of Syrian cuisine, Srdah set out to create a menu that showcased the best of his
            country’s
            dishes while also featuring Lebanese and Iraqi favorites.
            <br />
            <br />
            From our sizzling Iraqi kabab to our hand-crafted middle eastern appitizers, each dish is carefully crafted
            using traditional recipes passed down through generations. We use only the freshest ingredients, including
            herbs
            and spices imported directly from the Middle East, to ensure that every bite is bursting with flavor.
            <br />
            <br />
            With the addition of Huthaifa Al Aridi, our co-founder and pastry chef, our menu also includes an extensive
            selection of mouth-watering Middle Eastern sweets. Al Aridi brings 25 years of experience in making
            traditional
            sweets like Knafeh and Baklavas, which are now available for our customers to enjoy.
            <br />
            <br />
            Our restaurant is a culinary oasis for those seeking a true taste of the Middle East, with dishes like
            creamy
            hummus and crispy falafel that will transport your taste buds to the vibrant streets of Baghdad, Beirut, and
            Damascus. We prepare our food with love and care, using traditional recipes passed down through generations.
            Come and indulge in the rich flavors of our culture at <strong><i>Shifa's</i></strong>.
